# Deployment Environment Variables Setup

This document outlines the environment variables required for the build and deployment of the TabletalkRadar application.

## Required Environment Variables

### Supabase Configuration
These are required for the application to connect to the Supabase database and authentication system:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://pwscfkrouagstuyakfjj.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-app-domain.com
```

### Twilio Configuration
These are required for SMS functionality:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-phone-number
```

## Setup Instructions

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each of the above variables with their actual values
4. Make sure to set them for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### For Local Development:
Your `.env.local` file should contain the actual values for these variables.

### Build Process:
The application requires these environment variables to be available during the `next build` process because:
- API routes are statically analyzed during build
- Supabase client initialization happens at build time
- The build process validates that required services are accessible

## Security Note:
Never commit actual secret values to version control. Use your deployment platform's environment variable settings to provide the real values in production.
