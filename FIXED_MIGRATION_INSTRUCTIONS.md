# 🔧 Fixed Database Migration Instructions

## 🚨 Issue Identified
The error `column "platform" does not exist` occurred because:
- The `social_media_posts` table already existed in your database
- But it was missing several columns including `platform`
- The original migration tried to create the table instead of extending it

## ✅ Solution Created
I've created a **fixed migration** that safely:
- Checks if columns exist before adding them
- Extends existing tables instead of trying to recreate them
- Handles all edge cases with proper SQL conditionals

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Fixed Migration
In your Supabase SQL Editor, run this migration:

```sql
-- Copy the entire contents of:
-- database/migrations/015_comprehensive_client_profiles_fixed.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify the Migration Worked
Run this to check if everything is now properly set up:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-current-schema.ts
```

You should see:
- ✅ All tables exist (clients, client_locations, seo_keywords, business_services, business_menu, social_media_posts)
- ✅ All required columns are added
- ✅ No more "column does not exist" errors

## 🛡️ What the Fixed Migration Does

### Safely Extends Existing Tables:
- **clients** - Adds business info, branding, social links
- **client_locations** - Adds business hours, service areas
- **social_media_posts** - Adds missing columns like `platform`, `content`, etc.

### Creates New Tables:
- **seo_keywords** - Keyword rankings and tracking
- **business_services** - Service catalog with pricing
- **business_menu** - Menu items for restaurants

### Adds Security:
- Row Level Security policies
- Proper indexes for performance
- Agency isolation and client access controls

## 🎯 After Migration Success

Once the migration runs successfully:

1. **Test the Profile View**:
   - Go to any client dashboard: `/clients/[client-slug]`
   - Click the "Profile" tab
   - You should see the comprehensive profile interface

2. **Add Sample Data** (optional):
   ```sql
   -- Add a sample service
   INSERT INTO business_services (client_id, name, description, category, price_min, price_max, is_active)
   VALUES ('your-client-id', 'Thai Massage', '60-minute traditional Thai massage', 'Wellness', 80.00, 120.00, true);
   
   -- Add sample SEO keyword
   INSERT INTO seo_keywords (client_id, keyword, current_rank, search_volume, competition_level)
   VALUES ('your-client-id', 'thai restaurant near me', 12, 1500, 'high');
   ```

3. **Test All Profile Tabs**:
   - Overview: Business information and metrics
   - Locations: Business hours and performance
   - Services: Service catalog (if added)
   - SEO: Keyword rankings (if added)
   - Social: Social media posts
   - Menu: Menu items (if added)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check specific error message** and let me know
2. **Run the schema check script** to see current state
3. **Try running individual parts** of the migration

The fixed migration uses safe SQL practices with `IF NOT EXISTS` checks, so it won't break even if run multiple times.
